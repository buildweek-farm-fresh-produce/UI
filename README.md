##About Farm Fresh Produce:

We are a company designed to allow consumers to get their produce directly from farmers. This cuts out the 'middle man' and allows consumers to get fresher produce!

##Layout:

When opening the html for this page you will find several buttons. 

The **Home** button allows you to go back to the home page.

The **Log In** will redirect you to a application that will ask for your username and password so that you may access your dashboard.

The **Consumer** button redirects you to the login/sign up page for the consumer. AFterwards, you will be taken to your dashboard which will allow you to either view your orders (past and present) or to buy from local farmers.

The **Farmer** button redirects you to the login/sign up page for the farmer. Afterwards, you will be taken to your dashboard which will allow you to either view orders made from consumers (current or past) or to sell your inventory.

The **About** page gives information on the team that developed Farm Fresh Produce including a link to their Git Hub accounts.

### We hope you enjoy Farm Fresh Produce and look forward to doing business with you in the future!

**Sincerely,**
